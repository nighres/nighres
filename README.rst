Nighres
=======

Nighres is a Python package for processing of high-resolution neuroimaging data.
It developed out of `CBS High-Res Brain Processing Tools
<https://www.cbs.mpg.de/institute/software/cbs-tools>`_ and aims to make those
tools easier to install, use and extend.

You can get Nighres from PyPI::

    pip install nighres

If necessary, pip will also install Nighres' dependencies:

* Numpy
* Nibabel

For a detailed documentation and installation instructions visit http://nighres.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Currently, Nighres is developed and tested on Linux Ubuntu Trusty and Python 2.7. We hope to support all common Unix platforms and Python 3 soon.
